# AI Gen Nations
Through AI, quickly generate the baseline elements of a Nation.

Icons, images, etc are not in build scope, contributions (including translations and images), updates, corrections, etc are all welcome.

Nations developed:
- Israel

If you want to see how development of Israel played out, see the [ChatGPT conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/6749604f-d848-8013-b02c-c46c45654e1b) yourself!

So you say, pfft, AI gen? cheater! I say, don't knock it til you try it. If anything, this process turns dozens of hours of research and interpretation into, an hour or so of work. Reworking any issues from a generated nation is the easy part!

The most challenging part I've found is the usage of uniques. The AI only has exposure to the uniques list, so it kinda blurs some of the contextual language. Translating the desired uniques into modchecker compliant uniques takes a bit of time.

Anyway, it's an experiment, and we'll see how it goes.
